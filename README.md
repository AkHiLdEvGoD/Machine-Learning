Projects on various ML models 

## Projects on Classification models in Data Science

In **Adult Income Dataset**, I have used following models :-
- KNN ~ 86% Accuracy
- Naive Bayes ~ 80% Accuracy
- Random Forest ~ 87% Accuracy

## Algorithms from Scratch

- Ensemble ML models without the use of Sklearn libraries.
- Only use of Decision tree of library is there to avoid making it over complicated.
- Code implementation along with Visual Representation in form of Matplotlib plots.

## Gradient Descent from Scratch

- Implemented gradient descent on a signle feature, single target dataset
- Plotted graphs between weights and intercept wrt no of epochs
- Also plotted best fit line
